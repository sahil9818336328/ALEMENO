# Alemeno Courses

## Project Description

Alemeno is an innovative MERN-based courses platform designed to deliver a seamless and enriching learning experience. With a robust authentication system employing JSON Web Tokens (JWT), Alemeno ensures the security and privacy of user data, guaranteeing a safe learning environment.

### Key Features

1. **Authentication System with JWT and HTTP-Only Cookies:**
    - Alemeno prioritizes user security by implementing a state-of-the-art authentication system utilizing JSON Web Tokens. This ensures that user data remains protected and confidential.
    - Alemeno's authentication system employs a robust combination of JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and HTTP-only cookies to ensure secure and seamless user authentication. JWTs are utilized to encode user information and generate access tokens, which are then securely stored in HTTP-only cookies. This approach enhances security by mitigating common vulnerabilities associated with client-side storage of sensitive data.
    - By utilizing JWTs, Alemeno enables efficient and stateless authentication, reducing server-side storage requirements. The HTTP-only cookies further bolster security by preventing client-side JavaScript from accessing the token, safeguarding against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
    - This dual-layered authentication system provides a robust defense against unauthorized access while maintaining a user-friendly experience. It allows Alemeno to deliver a secure and reliable platform for learners and instructors alike.

2. **Browse All Courses:**
    - Alemeno provides users with a user-friendly interface to effortlessly explore a diverse range of courses.

3. **Course Creation:**
    - Alemeno allows instructors (aka users in this context) to effortlessly add new courses to the platform.

4. **Enrollment and Progress Tracking:**
    - Users can seamlessly enroll in courses, track their progress, and mark completed lessons.

5. **Personalized Stats Page:**
    - Alemeno provides users with a dedicated statistics page to view information such as the total number of users, the total number of courses the user is enrolled in, etc.
